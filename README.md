# Recipe Book Webapp

This project contains a very simple frontâ€‘end web application for keeping personal recipes and planning meals. There is no backend server, so data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

## Features

- Create, view, update and delete recipes
- List all saved recipes
- Plan recipes for each day of the week

## Usage

Open `webapp/index.html` in a web browser. All other pages can be reached through the navigation links.
